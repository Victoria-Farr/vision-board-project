# Skillcrush Vision Board Bonus Project 2021

In this project, a vision board webpage was created that includes some great aspirations in a lovely layout. (If you‚Äôre not familiar with vision boards, they are virtual or physical boards where you place your hopes and dreams.) This was primarily a project to practice skills at writing divs, clearing floats, styling text, and more.
